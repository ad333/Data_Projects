#  Summary: 
#       This program analyzes financial records of a company using revenue data from a CSV
#       file.  Then it prints the analysis to the terminal as well as exports results 
#       to a text file ("outputfile_pybank.txt").  Although the program was tested for both 
#       CSV files, the calculated results shown here were obtained using "budget_data_2.csv"
